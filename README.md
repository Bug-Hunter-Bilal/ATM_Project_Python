Python ATM System Simulation
A simple ATM System project in Python that simulates basic ATM operations.
This project is part of my Python learning journey, following my Contacts Book and Student Grades Manager projects.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This Python ATM project is designed as a menu-driven program that allows users to:

Secure PIN Verification with 3 attempts

Check Account Balance instantly

Deposit Money to the account

Withdraw Money safely with balance checks

View Complete Transaction History

Exit Menu anytime

The system mimics a real ATM workflow, helping beginners understand loops, functions, and list usage in Python.

ðŸ”¹ Features
âœ… PIN verification with limited attempts
âœ… Deposit & Withdraw with validation
âœ… Track transaction history dynamically
âœ… Menu repeats until user exits
âœ… Beginner-friendly Python code

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

IDE Used: VS Code

Concepts Practiced:

Variables & Data Types

Loops (for, while)

Conditional Statements

Functions

Lists for transaction history

User input & string formatting

ðŸ”¹ Installation & Usage
Clone the Repository


Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Bug-Hunter-Bilal/ATM_Project_Python.git
cd ATM_Project_Python
Run the Program


Copy
Edit
python atm.py
Default Login

PIN: 1234

Change the PIN in the code for your own security simulation.

ðŸ”¹ Example Output

Copy
Edit
Welcome to the ATM.
Enter your 4 digit PIN: 1234
 PIN Verified Successfully!

===== Main Menu =====
1. Check Balance
2. Deposit Money
3. Withdraw Money
4. Transaction History
5. Exit


ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements
Add multiple user accounts

Implement data storage in files for persistent balance

Add interest calculations for savings



ðŸ”¹ My Learning Journey
This project is the third milestone in my Python journey:

Contacts Book â€“ Manage names and numbers

Student Grades Manager â€“ Store marks and calculate grades

ATM Simulation â€“ Real-life inspired Python project

With each project, Iâ€™m getting closer to freelancing opportunities and career-ready Python skills.
